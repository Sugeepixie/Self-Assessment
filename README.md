## Self Assessment

* It was a great 24 weeks of learning Data Analytics. With the skills I gained through the course, I was able to collborate with my team and complete final project successfully.
* Contributed by setting up GIT HUB repository, creating branches for all team members, extracting data, working thru SQLlite creating databases, reviewing code in  Jupyter notebook, resolving GIT HUB merge issues, and creating Tableau dashboard.
* By consistent contribution, I was able to help my team progress towards our dream project while mastering some of the skills that I need to work on.
* Public speaking is my biggest fear and I have done that with confidence on my last day.

## Team Assesssment

* Team work makes dream work. We had excellent collaboration and made ourselves readily available through Slack for project work outside of class time. Challenges included coordinating meeting time, resloving merge conflicts on GIT HUB and completing weekly work on time.
* Team members had good rapport, clear commuincation, positive attitude, and were readily available to step in to solve any problems we faced.
* Above all, the guidance we recieved from chief instructor, TAs, Tutors, and Ask BCS  through out the 24 weeks  played a key role in the success of my course completion.


## Summary of Project

The project analyzes the features of mushrooms to determine if they are edible or poisonous. Technologies used for this project are Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Tableau. Machine Learning Model was created using Random Forest Classifier which we thought was the best to analyze categorical data. Then the model was trained using test_train_split function. The next step was to make Predictions and validate the model. Based on our analysis, the accuracy score recieved was 100% which implies that our features are best predictors of our classes(edible or poisonous).
